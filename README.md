# Fat-jar

Take a look at the _build.sbt_ and search for the entry _packageOptions_. Enter the fully qualified class name 
of your primary verticle. This will be used as entry point for a generated fat-jar.

To create the runnable fat-jar use:
```
sbt assembly
```


# Dockerize

The project also contains everything you need to create a Docker-container. Simply run the following command to package your fat-jar inside a Docker-container

```
sbt docker
```

To run use

```
docker run -p 8666:8666 default/vertx-scala-sbt
```
